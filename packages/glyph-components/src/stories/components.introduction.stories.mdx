#### WebComponents library implemented with [StencilJS](https://stenciljs.com)

This library born to allow developers to use whatever framework they like to implement an application with a look and feel similar to Drive.
Until this day we were tied to Angular as main framework, with a big component library implemented in it.

## Why WebComponents?

Using webcomponents we are creating a set of native components that can be used in any framework. The only thing we'll need to care about
is the correct project import and pass attributes to components correctly.

## Install

```bash
  # yarn 
  yarn add glyph-components 
  
  # npm 
  npm i glyph-components
```

## Use

To use it as WebComponents, check StencilJS Javascript integration [DOCS](https://stenciljs.com/docs/javascript)

For components accepting complex input properties you should set component attributes manually using JS in a script tag.

```html
<todo-list></todo-list>
<script>
  const todoListElement = document.querySelector('todo-list');
  todoListElement.myObject = {};
  todoListElement.myArray = [];
</script>
```

> Take a look at [Glyph React DOCS](https://adrianiy.github.io/glyph-ui/?path=/story/react_introduction--page).

## Local Development

Execute

```bash
  yarn start # start stenciljs dev server


yarn start:dev # start dev server and documentation
```
