# GlyphUI-React-Components
#### React library implemented over webComponents


This library allow to share logic across Drive React applications. Developers do not need to care about how components interact with application state, or how they
transform raw data into usable components.

## Install

```bash 
# yarn
yarn add glyph-react 

# npm 
npm i glyph-react
```

## Use

To use this React library simply import components where you want to use them.

```javascript
import { GlyphReactList } from 'glyph-react';

...

    return (
        <div className="App">
            <div className="list">
                <GlyphReactList title={'List'} limit={3} data={data} fieldsConfig={fieldsConfig} />
            </div>
        </div>
    );
...
```

## Local Development

Execute

```bash
yarn react start:docs
```

You'll have react docs available on port *6009*.

### Using demo playground

To use react playground correctly you'll need to simulate a real-world installation. In order to do this you'll nedd to link `peerDependencies` from *react-demo* to *glyph-react*.

Execute these commands

```bash
cd packages/react-demo/node_modules/react
yarn link
cd ../react-dom
yarn link
cd ../react-redux
yarn link
cd ../redux
yarn link
cd ../../../glyph-react
yarn link react react-dom react-redux redux
```

Now you can run the playground! Happy coding!

```bash
yarn react start
```

You'll have a react application running on port *3000*
