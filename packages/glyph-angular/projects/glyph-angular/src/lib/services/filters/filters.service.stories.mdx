# Filters Services
##### FilterService

Injectable service that manages the core of Drive applications, **FILTERS**.

This will keep an state of which filters are applied and which are not. Will also apply
some logic on selection like filter relations management *Section -> Product line*.

### Logic inheritance

All logic implementation will lay on *glyph-core* vanilla javascript functions.

For this particular case we'll use a ***redux-like*** implementation, so this is a wrapper to
adapt Redux to Angular injectable services.
