# SynthUI-React-Components
#### React library implemented over webComponents

This library allow to share logic across Drive React applications. Developers do not need to care about how components interact with application state, or how they
transform raw data into usable components.

## Install

🚧 The library is not currently published

## Use

To use this React library simply import components where you want to use them.

```javascript
import { SynthReactList } from 'synth-react';

...

    return (
        <div className="App">
            <div className="list">
                <SynthReactList title={'List'} limit={3} data={data} fieldsConfig={fieldsConfig} />
            </div>
        </div>
    );
...
```
