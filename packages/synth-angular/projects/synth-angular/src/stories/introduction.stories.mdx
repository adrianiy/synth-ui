# SynthUI-Angular-Components
#### Angular library implemented over webComponents

This library allow to share logic across Drive Angular applications. Developers do not need to care about how components interact with application state, or how they
transform raw data into usable components.

## Install

🚧 The library is not currently published

## Use

To use it as Angular Component library, simply import modules in app.module so you can use in all your app.

You can import Services module too, this will inject some common services in root (use `forRoot()`).
This needs an `environment` variable as first argument, this will be used by services to get environment app variables.

```javascript
import { SynthComponentsModule, SynthServicesModule } from 'synth-angular';

@NgModule({
    declarations: [ ... ],
    imports: [
        ...
        SynthComponentsModule,
        SynthServicesModule.forRoot(environment),
        ...
    ],
    providers: [ ... ],
    bootstrap: [ ... ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Custom services implementations

The second argument of `SynthServicesModule.forRoot()` is an object of classes to inject your custom services implementations in root.

You can create a custom class that extends FilterService

```javascript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { SynthFilterService } from 'synth-angular'

@Injectable()
export class CustomFiltersServie extends SynthFilterService {
  constructor(...) {
    super(...)
  }

  // this is an extended method
  initializeFilters(...) {
    super.initializeFilters(...);
    // Custom filters initialization logic
  }

  // this is a new method
  customMethod() {
    // this is a custom method
  }
}
```

Now you can pass an object to `forRoot` informed with your custom implementations

```javascript
import { SynthComponentsModule, SynthServicesModule } from 'synth-angular';

@NgModule({
    declarations: [ ... ],
    imports: [
        ...
        SynthServicesModule.forRoot(environment, { synthFilterService: CustomFiltersServie }),
        ...
    ],
    providers: [ ... ],
    bootstrap: [ ... ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```


## Local Development
