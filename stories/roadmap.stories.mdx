# Roadmap

Our team is contantly working on creating and improving components.

In this page we will describe what we are working on **now** and what's planned for **next** releases.

## Now

We are currently working in the first library version.

This will be an **MVP** (mimimum viable product) release, so will be usable only under simple applications.
