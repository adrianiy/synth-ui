# Roadmap

Our team is contantly working on creating and improving components.

In this page we will describe what we are working on **now** and what's planned for **next** releases.

## Now

We are currently working in the first library version.

This will be an MVP (mimimum viable product) release, so will be usable only under simple applications.

### Components

- List
    - ~~Basic list~~
    - Download excel [#26](https://github.com/adrianiy/synth-ui/issues/26)
    - ~~Actions button~~ [#27](https://github.com/adrianiy/synth-ui/issues/27)
- ~~No Data~~
- ~~Loader~~ [#13](https://github.com/adrianiy/synth-ui/issues/13)
- Header [#14](https://github.com/adrianiy/synth-ui/issues/14)
- Simple filters (?) [#16](https://github.com/adrianiy/synth-ui/issues/14)

### React

- ~~List~~ [#25](https://github.com/adrianiy/synth-ui/issues/25)

### Core

- Base Filters state management
    - Load initial filters [#6](https://github.com/adrianiy/synth-ui/issues/6)
    - Select option [#24](https://github.com/adrianiy/synth-ui/issues/24)
- Basic middlewares to configure framework [#15](https://github.com/adrianiy/synth-ui/issues/6)

### Release date

TBC


## Next

We'll implement step by step all components present in old ng-drivecommons.

To start we should have **all filter behaviour migrated to this library**, this will consume a big amount of time.
