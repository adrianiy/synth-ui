# Roadmap

Our team is contantly working on creating and improving components.

In this page we will describe what we are working on **now** and what's planned for **next** releases.

## Now

We are currently working in the first library version.

This will be an MVP (mimimum viable product) release, so will be usable only under simple applications.

### Components

- ~~List~~ 
- ~~No Data~~
- Loader [#13](https://github.com/adrianiy/synth-ui/issues/13)
- Header [#14](https://github.com/adrianiy/synth-ui/issues/14)
- Simple filters (?) [#16](https://github.com/adrianiy/synth-ui/issues/14)

### Core

- Base Filters state management [#6](https://github.com/adrianiy/synth-ui/issues/6)
- Basic middlewares to configure framework [#15](https://github.com/adrianiy/synth-ui/issues/6)

### Release date

TBC


## Next

We'll implement step by step all components present in old ng-drivecommons.

To start we should have **all filter behaviour migrated to this library**, this will consume a big amount of time.
