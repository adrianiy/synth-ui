### Use it

Choose a implementations that matches your favourite framework!

#### As Web Components

🚧 under construction

## As Developer

### Install

```bash
  yarn
```

To make **react-demo** work locally you'll need to simlink `react` and `react-dom` deps between **react-demo** and **synth-react** so they use the same exact version.

```bash
cd packages/react-demo/node_modules/react
npm link
cd ../react-dom
npm link
cd ../../synth-react
npm link react
npm link react-dom
```

### Run

These are the reserved ports for each app:

- **Docs**: 6006
    - ***WebComponents***: 6007
    - ***Angular***: 6008
    - ***React***: 6009
- **WebComponents**: 3333
- **Angular**: 4200
- **React**: 3000

#### Run everything

This is the main develpment script, this will open all framework watchers and Doc server.

The documentation will be visible at `localhost:6006` and will trigger `hmr` every time you change something anywhere in the code

```bash
  yarn start
```

#### Run only framework implementations 

If you need to test how web components are implemented in frameworks we recommend you to execute `yarn start:front`.
This script will open all frameworks syncronized in different ports, so if you change something in a higher layer framework or in the core
the demo application should trigger a `hmr` reload.

```bash
  yarn start:front
```


#### Run only documentation 

If you are going to modify docs only you should try this lightweighted script.

```bash
  yarn start:docs
```

#### Run by framework

You can run any package script by framework, let lerna do the job using `lerna run --scoped=*{fwk}* --parallel`.
You can type something like:

```bash
yarn react start
```

or

```bash
yarn angular build
```
