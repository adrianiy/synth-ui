# Getting Started

## As User

### Install

```bash
# web components
yarn add glyph-components

# react wrapper
yarn add glyph-react 

# angular wrapper 
yarn add glyph-angular
```

### Use it

Choose a implementations that matches your favourite framework!

#### As Web Components

Take a look at [STENCILJS](https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview) use guide.

```javascript
import { defineCustomElements } from 'glyph-components/dist/esm/loader';
defineCustomElements();
```

```html
<glyph-toggler></glyph-toggler>
```

#### As Angular Components

Angular exports two modules GlyphAngularComponents and GlyphAngularServices.

> Take a look at [Glyph Angular DOCS](https://adrianiy.github.io/glyph-ui/?path=/story/angular_introduction--page).

#### As React Components

React exports a wrapper for each `glyph-components` component [DOCS](https://adrianiy.github.io/glyph-ui/?path=/story/react_introduction--page)

A set of hooks to manage filters state are exported too [DOCS](https://adrianiy.github.io/glyph-ui/?path=/story/react_providers-filters--page)

#### As AmigaJS Middlewares

🚧 under construction

## As Developer

### Install

```bash
  yarn
```

To make **react-demo** work locally you'll need to simlink `react`,`react-dom`, `react-redux` and `redux` deps between **react-demo** and **glyph-react** so they use the same exact version.

```bash
cd packages/react-demo/node_modules/react
yarn link
cd ../react-dom
yarn link
cd ../react-redux
yarn link
cd ../redux
yarn link
cd ../../../glyph-react
yarn link react react-dom react-redux redux
```

### Run

These are the reserved ports for each app:

- **Docs**: 6006
    - ***WebComponents***: 6007
    - ***Angular***: 6008
    - ***React***: 6009
- **WebComponents**: 3333
- **Angular**: 4200
- **React**: 3000

#### Run everything

This is the main develpment script, this will open all framework watchers and Doc server.

The documentation will be visible at `localhost:6006` and will trigger `hmr` every time you change something anywhere in the code

```bash
  yarn start
```

#### Run only framework implementations

If you need to test how web components are implemented in frameworks we recommend you to execute `yarn start:front`.
This script will open all frameworks syncronized in different ports, so if you change something in a higher layer framework or in the core
the demo application should trigger a `hmr` reload.

```bash
  yarn start:front
```


#### Run only documentation

If you are going to modify docs only you should try this lightweighted script.

```bash
  yarn start:docs
```

#### Run by framework

You can run any package script by framework, let lerna do the job using `lerna run --scoped=*{fwk}* --parallel`.
You can type something like:

```bash
yarn react start
```

or

```bash
yarn angular build
```
