### Run

These are the reserved ports for each app:

- **Docs**: 6006.
- **WebComponents**: 1338
- **Angular**: 4200

#### Run everything

This is the main develpment script, this will open all framework watchers and Doc server.

The documentation will be visible at `localhost:6006` and will trigger `hmr` every time you change something anywhere in the code

```bash
  npm start
```

#### Run only framework implementations 

If you need to test components within a framework implementation we recommend you to execute `npm start` on root folder.
This script will open all frameworks syncronized in different ports, so if you change something in a higher layer framework or in the core
the demo application should trigger a `hmr` reload.

```bash
  npm start:front
```

#### Run only documentation 

If you are going to modify docs only you should try this lightweighted script.

```bash
  npm run start:docs
```
