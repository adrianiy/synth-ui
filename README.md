# SYNTH UI

A cross-framework component library.

For more info refer to [DOCS](https://adrianiy.github.io/synth-ui)

## Why?

As our team grows we are using more and more frameworks on our daily basis. We cannot be tied to a single framework anymore.

The **SynthUI Design System** was created to help us **build products more efficiently**. Established to be the **single source of truth**
for product teams working on Drive products. The SynthUI Design System contains everything from Getting Started guides to core components
and Vanilla Javascript functions intended to help product teams to desing and develop with speed, **consistency and quality, no matter
which framework your team have choosen**.

### Objectives & Benefits

#### Consistency

Create a common set of principles, resources, and components to improve consistency and user experience across Drive-like products.

#### Efficiency

Develop an unified system, with appropiate controls, and quality management, to increase teams productivity.

## How?

We've implemented a "multi-layer" components library composed by a core of web-compenents playing alongside with a higher level layers for each
most common frameworks. We have included also a set of vanillaJS functions and AmigaJS middelwares that should be able to use in your project to manage application's state
and back-to-front backends.

-   **Core**:
    -   JS Functions (based on Redux implementation) to manage application's state
    -   Middlewares to use in AmigaJS Framework.
    -   Common JS Functions like list transforms, etc.
    -   Common Interfaces.
-   **Components**: Web components usable in any framework.
-   **Angular**: Wrapper for components that implements angular particularities, it should contain only logic to communicate **components** with **core**.
-   **React**: Wrapper for components that implements react particularities, it should contain only logic to communicate **components** with **core**.
