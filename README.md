# GLYPH UI

A cross-framework component library.

For more info refer to [DOCS](https://adrianiy.github.io/glyph-ui)

## Why?

As our team grows we are using more and more frameworks on our daily basis. We cannot be tied to a single framework anymore.

The **GlyphUI Design System** was created to help us **build products more efficiently**. Established to be the **single source of truth**
for product teams working on Drive products. The GlyphUI Design System contains everything from Getting Started guides to core components
and Vanilla Javascript functions intended to help product teams to desing and develop with speed, **consistency and quality, no matter
which framework your team have choosen**.

### Objectives & Benefits

#### Consistency

Create a common set of principles, resources, and components to improve consistency and user experience across Drive-like products.

#### Efficiency

Develop an unified system, with appropiate controls, and quality management, to increase teams productivity.

## How?

We've implemented a "multi-layer" components library composed by a core of web-compenents playing alongside with a higher level layers for each
most common frameworks. We have included also a set of vanillaJS functions and AmigaJS middelwares that should be able to use in your project to manage application's state
and back-to-front backends.

-   **Components**: Web components usable in any framework.
-   **Angular**: Wrapper for components that implements angular particularities.
-   **React**: Wrapper for components that implements react particularities.
-   **Core**:
    -   JS Functions (based on Redux implementation) to manage application's state
    -   Middlewares to use in AmigaJS Framework.

## Do you want to create a Drive-Like Application?

### This is your solution!

Do you need your application to look like _Drive_? Or just use the logic behind filter and search management?

Even if you only want to use one of our components, we've created this library for you :)
